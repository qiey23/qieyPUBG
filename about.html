      <div class="neon-paragraph">
        <p>My journey in education has been filled with memorable milestones and consistent hard work. I began my schooling years with a strong foundation at primary school, achieving excellent results in the UPSR with 6As. This early success motivated me to strive further.</p>
        <p>In my religious education, I earned 8As in the UPKK exam, reflecting both my academic and spiritual development. These achievements helped me build strong discipline and time management skills.</p>
        <p>I continued to excel during secondary school, where I proudly scored 3As in the SPM examination. These results opened many doors and further confirmed my dedication to learning and personal growth.</p>
        <p>My passion for knowledge and curiosity in various subjects have shaped who I am today — someone who values education as a lifelong journey.</p>
